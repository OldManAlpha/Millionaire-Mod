# Millionaire Mod for Monopoly Deal
This mod allows you to play Millionaire Edition. This also serves as an example of what mods can do. One caveat with this mod is that due to the lack of needed infrastructure, the values of cards are scaled to 1M per 50K. Therefore, the objective of the game is to reach 20M, not 1000K. The gameplay is still effectively exactly the same.

## How To Install and Play
Download the jar and put it in your server's `mods` folder. If you installed Monopoly Deal using the installer, your server's `mods` folder is located at `C:\Users\<Username>\AppData\Roaming\Monopoly Deal\server\mods`. After installing the jar file, you can start the server and use the `/setdeck millionaire` command to use the Millionaire deck.
