# Millionaire Mod for Monopoly Deal
This mod allows you to play Millionaire Edition on [Monopoly Deal](https://github.com/OldManAlpha/Monopoly-Deal). This also serves as an example of what mods can do. One caveat with this mod is that due to the lack of needed infrastructure, the values of cards are scaled to 1M per 50K. Therefore, the objective of the game is to reach 20M, not 1000K. The gameplay is still effectively exactly the same.

## What is Millionaire Edition?
Millionaire Edition mainly changes the objective of the game, requiring players to reach a certain amount of money in their bank to win the game. It also adds an additional action card. Here's a list of changes:

- The objective to win the game is to be the first to have 20M in the bank.
- There are only 1M and 2M money cards, but there’s much more of them.
- Action cards cannot be banked.
- Railroads and utilities are gone, but Gold-colored properties are added, which are extremely valuable and charge very high rent.
- There are no houses and hotels.
- You must pay rent with money before properties.
- Rent charges are usually greater for sets with only 1 property.
- It’s My Birthday charges 1M; Debt Collector charges 6M
- New Action Card Added: Race Ahead
  - Use on your last move to immediately start your next turn.
